### Overview 
In this project, the objective is to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various features suach as 
- Pregnancies
- Insulin Level
- Age
- BMI.
The data set that has used in this project has taken from the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) . "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage." and used a simple [random forest classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest).   


### Learning Objective
The following points were the objective of the project . If you are looking for all the following points in this repo then i have not covered all in this repo. I'm working on blog about this mini project and I'll update the link of blog about all the points in details later . (The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.)  
- Data gathering 
- Descriptive Analysis 
- Data Visualizations 
- Data Preprocessing 
- Data Modelling 
- Model Evaluation 
- Model Deployment 

### Technical Aspect 

- Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn. 
- Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku. 
- A user has to put details like Number of Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI etc . 
- Once it get all the fields information , the prediction is displayed on a new page .
